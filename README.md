### Steps

- Create some small pieces of code to test CSS styles, fonts and colours.
- Play around with the JSON file and ensure I understand the structure of the data.
- Create the new directory and initialise webpack.
- Bring in the JSON file and store is as a variable.
- Using my test pieces of code as a guide, create the basic layout and page structures, making sure that it scales ok for mobile.
- Get the data I want to display in the content section, depending on which tab I click.
- Allow the data to be sorted alphabetically or by time (depending on the tab).
- Create the pop up and link it to the 'view' button on the main content page (using the test pop up code I worked on earlier).
- Think about future ideas.
- Ensure that the code all works and it is published to github pages.
