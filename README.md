### Future Ideas

- Have the 'Cymraeg' button actually translate to Welsh.
- Use the provided coordinates to show a pin on google maps.
- Improved mobile compatability.
- Menu button would let you access the University Website Menu
- Allow a further filter for individual letters (e.g. A, D)
- Add in a search bar to enable users to find the desired subject more quickly.

### Steps

- Create some small pieces of code to test CSS styles, fonts and colours.
- Play around with the JSON file and ensure I understand the structure of the data.
- Create the new directory and initialise webpack.
- Bring in the JSON file and store is as a variable.
- Using my test pieces of code as a guide, create the basic layout and page structures, making sure that it scales ok for mobile.
- Get the data I want to display in the content section, depending on which tab I click.
- Allow the data to be sorted alphabetically or by time (depending on the tab).
- Create the pop up and link it to the 'view' button on the main content page (using the test pop up code I worked on earlier).
- Think about future ideas.
- Ensure that the code all works and it is published to github pages.
